Pandas Data Analysis and Manipulation

This is a Python program that demonstrates how to use the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. 
Pandas is a powerful library for handling structured data in Python, and it provides many tools for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
How to Use the Program

To use the program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to have the Pandas library installed. 
You can install Pandas using the following command:

pip install pandas

Once you have installed Pandas, you can run the program by executing the main.py file using Python. The program loads a sample CSV file data.csv, 
which contains sample data for analysis.

The program demonstrates various operations that you can perform on the data using Pandas. These operations include:

    Loading data from a CSV file
    Displaying the first 5 rows of the data
    Getting basic statistics of the data
    Grouping data by a categorical variable
    Merging two dataframes by a common column
    Reshaping data using pivot tables
    Filtering data using boolean indexing
    Dropping missing values from the data
    Plotting data using matplotlib

You can modify the program to perform different operations on your own data. You can also add comments to the code to explain how each operation works and how it contributes 
to the data analysis.

Conclusion

This program is a great starting point for learning how to use the Pandas library for data analysis and manipulation. With Pandas, you can easily load, clean, transform, 
and analyze structured data in Python. The program provides a foundation for more advanced data analysis and visualization projects.
